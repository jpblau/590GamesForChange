Francine	Updates to the site?	Hey Alex, Francine here! I realized I’ve never actually sent you an email like this, have I? Usually I just talk to you on the forum. Anyways, there are just some updates I think we should make to the forum. I’ll attach details in a sec. Francine	A	Alright, I’ll keep an eye out.

Francine	The actual details	So. Okay. Basically we need to be able to get in more ad revenue for the site, and since we’re the only two moderators...that’s our job. This month has been kinda janky since not too much people have been seeing that ads, which is weird. So we also need to figure that out. Francine	A	True, true.

Francine	Timeline?	When do you think we can start working on these? The sooner the better, so let’s make sure we don’t uhh slack off like last time. Francine	A	Haha, you’re right about that. I’ll see what I can do.

Francine	Other things to fix	Oh, I almost forgot! We also need to make sure that people who use the forum can actually use their own profile images. We’ve received a bunch of complaints that people don’t like using pictures from the game the site is based on, and they want to be able to be more creative with it. So that’s something to think about.Francine	A	Ok, sounds good!				
X								
Francine	Your opinion	But other than all of that, what else do you think we need to change or add? I want to make sure our forum is great. It’d be cool to put on a college application that we worked on something like this. Francine	A	Is the profile picture things needed? It’s a forum dedicated to the game, so people should be fine just getting profile pictures from the game. I think that’s enough, and then we can focus on cooler things instead.	A	Ok! Uhhh, maybe we could include video options or something? So people can post videos on the forum? We don’t have any support for that right now.	A	Let’s see...we can implement more features on each person’s profile. Or a friend’s list even? That could be cool.

Francine	Re:Your opinion	Huh. Okay, okay. Let’s see..I’ll also think about what else we can do. Thanks for your input, Alex! Francine	A	Anytime!				
X								
Francine	Kind of off topic	Anyways, I feel like we never talk about non forum stuff anymore. It’s funny to think that we first met on a different forum and now two years later we’re moderators for a different one. Time flies. Life is crazy. Francine	A	Yeah, we’re just both always so busy.				
X								
Francine	Re:Kind of off topic	We should still work on stuff when we’re both in college, it’s been really great. I can remember how when you first started dating Morgan, things kind of got away from you for a little while. You were rarely updating the site with me and modding stuff. It was like all me at that time. But then things calmed down and now we’re back at it again, making great things happen there. I love working with you, Alex. Francine	A	Yeah...lots of of stuff to do.				
X								
Francine	Quick apology	Oh sorry if my last email was maybe rude to Morgan, I didn’t mean for it to come off that way! Reading it over again though I realize that maybe it was. Sorry! Francine	A	It’s alright.				
X								
Francine	Anyways	Anyways, I’m gonna get to fixing some other small things on the site. If you need anything else, message me! Francine	A	Oh right, there was one thing actually. Bobby was looking for a job and I know we don’t really do this...but maybe we could fit him in as a mod? Or just fit him in somewhere?	A	I have one more idea. I think it’d be great to include Bobby as a moderator. He’s familiar with the game, maybe not as much as we are, but he’d be a great addition!	A	Well, Bobby messaged me and asked if he could also work on the site and get ad revenue and stuff, but I told him it’s probably not the best idea since we don’t really work that way. Figured I should let you know in case he ever contacts you.
X								
Francine	Re:Anyways	Oh...Bobby, right… does he still...have a thing for me? It’s probably best to not have him in on the site. No offense, I know you two are good friends and all. But I’ve never even met the guy in person and he claims to be crushing on me? Weird.	A	Yeah, I should try and talk some sense into him so he stops being gross.	A			
X								
Francine	Keep me updated	But hey, for now just keep me updated. Forum stuff, family stuff, love life, whatever. Let’s start talking like friends again, Alex! I feel like it’s been forever.	A	It has been forever, and of course!!
